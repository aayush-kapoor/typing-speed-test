# Typing Speed Test
A simple application, made using pygame, which tests the typing speed of the user and displays the result in words/minute along with the accuracy of the user.<br><br>
To make it more interesting, we used selenium library and web driver to automate how the sentences get selected, which are displayed for the user to type.
